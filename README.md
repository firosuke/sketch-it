# Hey Sketcher!

This simple drawing program allows you to create spirograph-like pastel drawings, load/save your work, and replay the drawing process.
It's fun to change the symmetry of your brush-strokes, change the randomly-generated color palettes, and replay your work.
I made this for my own use, so it is not exactly 'production code', but perhaps I will expand on it one day. I have a number of ideas for that!

To run this program, download the Processing graphical programming software, and paste and run this script there.
